O/p:

To execute the script, save it to a file (e.g., download_file.sh), grant execute permissions (chmod +x download_file.sh), and then run it:


./download_file.sh

Replace download_file.sh with the actual filename if you've named the script differently.
If the file exists on the FTP server, the script will output:


File exists. Downloading...
Download complete.
If the file does not exist, it will output:


File does not exist on FTP server.
