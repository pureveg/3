1.Extract Words:
Use grep to extract words from the file, and tr to convert all text to lowercase for case-insensitive counting.

grep -oE '\w+' wonderland.txt | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'

2.Sort Words:
Use sort to sort the words alphabetically.


grep -oE '\w+' wonderland.txt | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort

3.Count Word Frequencies:
Use uniq -c to count the frequency of each word.


grep -oE '\w+' wonderland.txt | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort | uniq -c

4.Sort by Frequency:
To sort the word frequencies in descending order, use sort -nr.


grep -oE '\w+' wonderland.txt | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

5.Putting it all together, the final command to generate a word frequency list for wonderland.txt is:


grep -oE '\w+' wonderland.txt | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr

This command extracts words from the file, converts them to lowercase, sorts them alphabetically, counts the frequency of each word, and then sorts the word frequencies in descending order.
